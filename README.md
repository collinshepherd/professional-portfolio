# professional-portfolio

## Description

I decided to build this portfolio to showcase my ability to create a webpage along with also making it to display additional projects that I have completed. This puts all of my materials and work that I have done all in one convenient place. I had to learn grid-templates for this project because I was unable to get it to look how I wanted to with flexboxes. I learned a lot about styling websites and also how complex certain designs can be.

## Example of Portfolio

## Usage

You can use this portfolio to see a little information about me as well as my projects that I have completed. My resume is also linked to the page if you wanted to see that as well.

## Credits

Shout out to Kevin Powell for the amazing CSS Grid youtube video. I was able to learn CSS Grid very easily from this video and if you are confused about it I definitely recommend watching this guide.
